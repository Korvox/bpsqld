Bottle backend server project notes by Matt

This server depends heavily on being run with an https forced server. There are ways to extend
bottle to require an https connection, but I could just set up gunicorn on Heroku with this:

secure_scheme_headers = {'X-FORWARDED-PROTO' : 'https'}

to force the server to only run on HTTPS. In production, you would want to have a failsafe in
the server code to make sure you aren't serving DB queries over unencrypted connections.
