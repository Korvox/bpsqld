Bottle backend server project notes by Matt

This server depends heavily on being run with an https forced server. There are ways to extend
bottle to require an https connection, but I could just set up gunicorn on Heroku with this:

secure_scheme_headers = {'X-FORWARDED-PROTO' : 'https'}

to force the server to only run on HTTPS. In production, you would want to have a failsafe in
the server code to make sure you aren't serving DB queries over unencrypted connections.

The way I wrote the server is impractical in a larger implementation. It would make more sense in
production to put the entire thing in a class, instanciate it from within if __name__ == __main__, 
and keep it all wrapped up nicely. Here, it just makes more sense to use the global namespace in
such a small project.

Heroku depends (just get latest):
Python3
Bottle
Psycopg2
Gunicorn
